\title{
Plot the Probability Weighting Function
}
\description{
Plots the Probability Weighting Function created by \code{\link{nullp}} by binning together genes.
}
\usage{
plotPWF(pwf,binsize="auto")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pwf}{
A data frame with 3 columns named DEgenes, bias.data & pwf.  Usually generated by \code{\link{nullp}}.
}
  \item{binsize}{
Calculate and plot the fraction of genes that are DE in bins of this size.  If set to "auto" the best binsize for visualization is attempted to be found automatically.
}
}
\details{
This function is almost always called using the output from the \code{\link{nullp}} function.  However, it can be used to visualize the length (or any other type of quantifyable) bias in ability to detect DE in a data set.  The \code{pwf} arguement needs to be a data frame with 3 column each containing numeric entries (although NAs are permitted in the bias.data and pwf columns), which must be named "DEgenes", "bias.data" and "pwf", although they can appear in any order.  The DEgenes column should be 0s or 1s where 1 represents a DE gene, 0 a gene which is not DE.  The bias.data column is a quantification of the quantity for which there is a bias in detecting DE for the associated gene, this is usually gene length or the number of counts associated with a gene.  Finally, the pwf column gives the probability weighting to be applied for a given gene.
